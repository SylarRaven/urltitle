# urltitle
**urltitle** uses Python 3.7 to return the page title or other description for a given URL.
Its intended primary use is the inclusion of the returned value in conversations.

## Features
* An in-memory cache is used with a default time of a week. The cache size and time are customizable.
* Approximately only the fraction of a page required to return a title is read, up to a maximum of 1 MiB.
* Up to three attempts are made for resiliency except if there is an unrecoverable error, i.e. 400, 401, or 404.
* A guess of `https` and otherwise `http` is made for a URL with a missing scheme, e.g. for "cnn.com" as opposed
to "https://cnn.com".
